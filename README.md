A Python program to calculate **Simple Interest (I)**.

## Formula
<div align="center">

$$
I = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

</div>

- **P** = Principal amount  
- **r** = Rate of interest (%)  
- **t** = Time (years)  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0PKunal/Simple-Interest-Calculator-in-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd /Simple-Interest-Calculator-in-Python
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
    python simple_interest.py
   ```
## Example

```
Enter the principal amount(P): 1000
Enter the rate of interest(r in %): 5
Enter the time(t in years): 2

Simple Interest(I) = 100.00
```
